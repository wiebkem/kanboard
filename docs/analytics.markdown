This chart show the average lead and cycle time for the last 1000 tasks over the time.

- The lead time is the time between the task creation and the date of completion.
- The cycle time is time between the specified start date of the task to completion date.
- If the task is not closed, the current time is used instead of the date of completion.

Those metrics are calculated and recorded everyday for the whole project.
