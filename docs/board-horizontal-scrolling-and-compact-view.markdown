Horizontal scrolling and compact mode
=====================================

When the board can't fit on your screen, an horizontal scroll bar will appear at the bottom.

However, it's possible to switch to the compact the view to display all columns in your screen.

Switching between horizontal scrolling and compact view can be done with the keyboard shortcut **"c"** or by using the dropdown menu on the top left.

Note: It's possible that text overlaps in compact mode, that will be improved over the next releases.
